Degradation Analysis & Extrapolation ToolA comprehensive Python tool for analyzing and predicting material degradation. This script fits various mathematical models to time-series data, generates detailed performance metrics, and creates insightful visualizations to forecast material lifespan.Table of ContentsFeaturesPrerequisitesInstallationHow to UseOutputContributingLicenseFeaturesData Preprocessing: Automatically cleans and processes time-series degradation data from Excel files.Multiple Model Fitting: Fits four different degradation models to the data:LinearLogarithmicPower LawExponentialPerformance Metrics: Calculates R-squared (R²), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each model to evaluate its fit.Prediction: Extrapolates degradation over time and predicts the number of days to reach a 50% degradation threshold.Data Visualization:Generates individual plots for each model, showing the actual data, the fitted curve, and the future prediction.Creates performance heatmaps to visually compare the R², MSE, and RMSE values across all models and material batches.Reporting:Generates summary tables in both the console and as CSV files.Creates a detailed text report summarizing the entire analysis.PrerequisitesBefore you can run this script, you need to have Python 3.6+ installed on your system.InstallationClone the repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required Python libraries from the requirements.txt file:pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file containing the libraries listed below.)pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
openpyxl
scipy
How to UsePrepare your data: You will need two Excel files, one for room temperature data and one for refrigerator temperature data. Each file should contain a time column (e.g., 'Day', 'Days', 'Time', 'Hours') and columns for the degradation percentage of different batches (e.g., 'Standard Batch (0%)', 'Neem, 25%').Run the script: Execute the Python script from your terminal:python Prediction.py
Provide file paths: The script will prompt you to enter the full paths to your two Excel files.Enter the path to the ROOM temperature data Excel file: /path/to/your/room_temp_data.xlsx
Enter the path to the REFRIGERATOR temperature data Excel file: /path/to/your/ref_temp_data.xlsx
Review the output: The script will save the results in two new sub-folders (graphs and results) in the same directory as your input files.OutputThe script generates the following outputs:Processed Data (/results folder): A CSV file for each input Excel file containing the cleaned and processed data.Graphs (/graphs folder):Individual PNG plots for each batch and each model.PNG heatmaps for R², MSE, and RMSE.Summary Tables (/results folder): CSV files summarizing performance metrics.Detailed Report (/results folder): A .txt file containing a comprehensive summary of the analysis.ContributingContributions are welcome!
